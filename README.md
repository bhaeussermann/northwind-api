# northwind-api
A RESTful API (hosted [here](https://northwind-express-api.herokuapp.com/swagger/)), implemented in Express, providing CRUD functionality for managing Employees in a PostgreSQL database.

*Note:* The API is hosted as showcase only. You're welcome to play with it, but don't consume it in your own application -- rather clone the repo and 
host it locally 😊

## Build

```
npm install
```

## Running

npm start
```
